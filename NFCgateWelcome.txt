Is there a place anywhere where you walk through a door, and the door recognizes you and greets you by name?

Kinda useless currently, but something rich people looking for attention could crave. Either that or an animatronic which greets them.

The technology could be used with phones by sensing them pass through the door, but would it reach?

If not NFC, what other sensors could work?
